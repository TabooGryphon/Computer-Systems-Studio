                <p>Welcome to my page on defensive football formations and stratagies. I created this page to consolidate information on the different football formation and the stratigies to go with them.
                This site is for people who have a general knowledge of the game of football and are looking to deepen that knowledge on the defensive side of the ball. If you're looking for a very indepth look on these stratagies and formations this site may not be what you're looking for. If you're a beginner to this or would like to refresh you knowledge I have included a video to catch you up.</p>

                <p>The key to running a successful defense is knowing your personnel. Running a defense that your players do not fit will not turn out well for you even if it is the correct defense against the play. When calling defensive plays, you call the play to stop what you think the offense is going to do and rely on the playmaking ability of your players to take care of the rest. I would suggest reading or listening about the philosophies of some top defensive coaches in the game today.</p><br>

                <p>There are many coaches that are successful and have great Philo. Find the one that fits your style and dive in. I have recommended two of the great minds when it comes to coaching defense currently, however they are not the only two.</p><br>
