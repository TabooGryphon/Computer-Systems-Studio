            <p>The 3-4 defense consists of three down linemen, four linebackers, and four defensive backs. The 3-4 defense is better than the 4-3 at defending the pass but can be less effective at defending the run.  It is more effective defending the pass because it has four linebackers as opposed to three in the 3-4. Defenses generally rush four players on pass plays, so with the 3-4 that fourth pass rusher can come from multiple positions without having to drop a defensive lineman into coverage. However due to the lineup your inside linebackers are easier for the offensive guards to get to and block, which may create larger holes in the run game. </p>

                    <dt>Defensive Line</dt>
                        <dd>The defensive line consists of one nose-guard and two defensive tackles. The nose-guard will line up across from the offensive center and has the responsibility of both center-guard gaps. The defensive tackles line up on accross from the offensive tackle and will rarely need to adjust because of a tight end. Their responsibilities are the guard-tackle gap and the outside tackle gap.</dd>
                    <br><dt>Linebackers</dt>
                        <dd>The inside linebackers lines up directly across from the offensive guards and are approximately 2-5 yards off the line of scrimmage. Inside linebackers have the general responsibility to get to the ball carrier. I know this sounds really simplified, but in the 3-4 defense the larger defensive lineman are meant to take up blocks and allow the inside linebackers to run free and make the plays. Outside linebackers line up on the outside should on the outside most player on the line of scrimmage or they may be up to a full yard outside that player. Their responsibilities are containing the ball carrier and backside pursuit. One of the outside linebackers is usually a very good pass rusher, but needs to be able to drop back in coverage as well.   </dd>
                    <br><dt>Defensive Backs</dt>
                        <dd>The cornerbacks will line up on opposite sides of the field across from the wide receivers, tight ends, or running backs. The distance from the line of scrimmage can range from 0 â€“ 8 yards depending on the coverage called. You may designate a strong and weak corner, but this is not necessary. The safeties will line up anywhere from 5-15 yards from the line of scrimmage and generally are behind the outside linebackers, but this may vary with different coverages. </dd>
