            <p>The 4-3 defense has four down lineman, three linebackers, and four defensive backs. It was orignally desigend to stop offenses using the wishbone offense. Today it is a strong run defense against 2 and 3 running back offenses. Even though the 4-3 is a strong run defense it can use multiple coverages, and with the right personnel can be a solid pass defense.</p>

                    <dt>Defensive Line</dt>
                        <dd>The defensive line consists of two tackles and two ends. The tackles generally line up across from the offensive guard and can have either the center-guard gap or guard-tackle gap responsibility. Ends usually line up on the outside shoulder of the offensive tackle but will adjust if there is a tight end. Their responsibility is to contain the ball carrier. </dd>
                    <br><dt>Linebackers</dt>
                        <dd>The middle linebacker lines up directly across from the offensive center and approximately 2-5 yards off the line of scrimmage. Their responsibility is the area between the defensive tackles, they will read the blocks of the center and guards and react accordingly. Outside linebackers will generally line up across from the offensive tackles and at the same distance off the line of scrimmage as the middle linebacker. Their responsibilities are similar to the defensive ends while defending the run but will have different responsibilities defending the pass. </dd>
                    <br><dt>Defensive Backs</dt>
                        <dd>The cornerbacks will line up on opposite sides of the field across from the wide receivers, tight ends, or running backs. The distance from the line of scrimmage can range from 0 â€“ 8 yards depending on the coverage called. You may designate a strong and weak corner, but this is not necessary. The safeties will line up anywhere from 5-15 yards from the line of scrimmage and generally are behind the outside linebackers, but this may vary with different coverages. </dd>
