#Computer Systems Studio#

##Site Purpose##

    I made this site to consolidate information about different football defenses into one website.
    
##Paged##

    I created pages for the 4-3, 3-4, and 5-2 defenses as well as a drawing board, game, contact, and position comparision page.

##Features##

    The features that I included in the website are the drawing board, game, scrolling football behind header, drop down nav menu, embedded YouTube video and hyperlinks to various sites relating to the topic.
    
##Design Desisions##

    I choose the color scheme I did because they fit with the topic of football and they would contrast with each other nicely.
    
##Problems and Challanges##

    Throughout the project I had many challanges and problems. 
        
        *Organizing different sections, images, and javascript from front to back.
            *This problem can be sovled using Z-index.
            
        *Trouble shooting was difficult in multiple ways. But the two big issues I had was if the program isn't working on the web page then it is very challanging to fix. Also if anyother media is failing to load such as images, it can be hard to tell what the problem is without redoing everything step-by-step and even then it didn't fix the issue.
            *I solved this by using developer tools for Google Chrome browser.
            
        *When adding content to an already existing site it can be easy to overlook how you have your directory set up for different files. 
        
##Knowledge and Experience##
    
    *Being able to troubleshoot my own problems was nice and helped me gain an understanding of how to look for issues.
    
    *Placing the javascript behind my header was very challanging and allowed me to use different HTML and CSS code to solve the problem.
    
    *Going without the net of supervision was great so I would have to find the cause of my problems, as well as broading my knowledge of HTML and CSS that we may not have covered in class.
